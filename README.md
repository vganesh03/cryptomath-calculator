A cryptographic calculator made in Python's cross platform framework "Kivy".

My first android application, developed entirely in Python (using the Kivy framework).

This application incorporates all the mathematical concepts learnt in the 1st unit of the Cryptography subject of 6th sem. This app is easy to use, has a clean, simple UI and pinpoint accuracy in results.
The operations supported in this application:
1. Modular Exponentiation
2. Greatest Common Divisor
3. Multiplicative inverse
4. Miller-Rabin Primality
5. Fermat Prime Factorization
6. Euler Totient Function
7. Euler Theorem
8. Chinese Remainder Theorem
9. Coprimality Test
10. Discrete Logarithm Problem

This application requires NO internet to function. 
So, say goodbye to opening lots of browser tabs for each operation as this application integrates all these into one app.

There are NO apps in the market with such functionality, so continuous development is taking place to include more functions and enhance the user experience, ensuring that the CryptoMath Calculator remains the go-to app for all cryptographic calculations.
